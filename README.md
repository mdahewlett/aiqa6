# 6th Time At This

## This time around

- My focus is trying to speed run it and get smoother with the deployment step

## Notes

- next time can skip FE code, except for fetch and status handling
- BE much better with adding pw, limiter, openai format
- still origins on FE and BE to be flexible some work
- setting up env, activate from terminal then open vs code
- still did not know a lot of the dockerfile, dockercompose, and nginx in terms of what to write, but understood what was there
- found some more typos in dockerfile, fewer in nginx conf, and my list of things to go through was smoother for setting up the server, only took 1h45m instead of 4h!
